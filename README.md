# Acne-Detection-Using-YOLOv8-and-MediaPipe
This project is a smart, deep-learning-based solution that detects acne on different regions of the face using a custom-trained YOLOv8 model. It combines facial landmark detection with object detection to give region-wise acne analysis — like on the cheeks, forehead, and under the eyes — rather than just saying "acne or no acne."
